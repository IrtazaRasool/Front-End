This project demonstrates a dynamic, scroll-based animation built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP, and Locomotive Scroll. The web page includes engaging animations, canvas rendering, and scroll-triggered interactions to create an immersive user experience.

## Features
- Scroll-Based Animations: Implemented using GSAP and Locomotive Scroll for smooth and interactive animations triggered by the user’s scroll position.
- Canvas Animation: High-performance canvas rendering synced with scroll for a seamless animation flow.
- Responsive Design: Fully responsive across different screen sizes, ensuring consistent user experience on both desktop and mobile.
- Performance Optimization: Smooth transitions and optimized rendering for better performance on various devices.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: Markup structure for the web page.
- CSS3: Styling for layout, responsiveness, and animations.
- JavaScript (ES6): Core functionality and DOM manipulation.
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): For scroll-triggered animations and timeline management.
- Locomotive Scroll: For enhancing smooth scrolling effects and scroll-based triggers.
- Canvas API: Used for rendering image sequences dynamically within the scroll animation.
